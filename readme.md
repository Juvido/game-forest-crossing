## About the game
A narrative-style game. 
This is a game built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of a bootcamp project at Ironhack.

## What is the story?
Your objective is to cross a forest with dark trails and strange creatures, in order to fulfill your mission of delivering a sacred hammer to the leader of the dwarves. With each choice, you may be closer to the end of your mission, whether by reaching your objective or losing your life.
